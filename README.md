## Project Description

**HubConnect** is a modern, multi-page community platform built with React and Vite. It demonstrates advanced React patterns including client-side routing, custom hooks, state management, and responsive design. The application allows developers to discover, share, and discuss topics in a collaborative space with features like post creation, liking, searching, and dark mode support.

This project showcases mastery of:
- React Router for multi-page navigation
- Custom hooks for reusable logic
- Data fetching and API integration
- Component composition and props
- LocalStorage persistence
- Responsive design principles

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend Framework:** React 18.2.0
- **Build Tool:** Vite 4.3.0
- **Routing:** React Router DOM 6.20.0
- **Styling:** CSS Modules
- **State Management:** React Hooks (useState, useEffect, useCallback)
- **Storage:** Browser LocalStorage API
- **API:** JSONPlaceholder (mock data)
- **Code Quality:** ESLint 9.39.4

## Features

### ✅ **Core Functionality**
- 🏠 **Home Page** - Welcome section with featured community posts and call-to-action buttons
- 📝 **Posts Feed** - Comprehensive list of all community posts with real-time search/filter
- ➕ **Create Post** - Form to compose and publish new posts to the community
- 👁️ **Post Detail View** - Full post page with expanded content and metadata
- ℹ️ **About Page** - Project information, mission, vision, and core values
- 📞 **Contact Page** - Contact form with social media links (X, LinkedIn, Discord, GitHub)
- 🚫 **404 Page** - Custom not-found page for invalid routes

### ✨ **User Experience Features**
- ❤️ **Like System** - Like/unlike posts with persistent like counts displayed as "X Likes"
- 🔍 **Search Posts** - Real-time search filtering by post title or content
- 🗑️ **Delete Own Posts** - Users can delete posts they created (not API posts)
- 🌙 **Dark Mode Toggle** - Switch between light and dark themes (persisted via localStorage)
- 📱 **Responsive Design** - Optimized for desktop (3-column grid), tablet (2-column), and mobile (1-column)
- 💾 **Data Persistence** - User-created posts, likes, and theme preference saved to localStorage

### 🔧 **Technical Highlights**
- Custom `useFetch` hook for clean API data fetching with loading/error states
- Custom `useLocalStorage` hook for seamless browser storage integration
- Custom `usePostLikes` hook for like count management and toggle logic
- Custom `useForm` hook for form state and validation handling
- CSS Modules for component-scoped styling (no global conflicts)
- Responsive grid layout with CSS media queries

Lessons Learned
- React & Hooks
- Mastered functional components and React Hooks (useState, useEffect, useCallback, useContext)
- Built custom hooks to abstract complex logic and promote code reusability
- Understood dependency arrays and cleanup functions in useEffect
- Routing & Navigation
- Implemented client-side routing with React Router v6
- Learned nested routes, route parameters, and navigation with useNavigate and useParams
- Understood the Outlet component and layout wrapping patterns
-State Management
- Managed both local component state and global browser storage (localStorage)
- Learned when to use useState vs. custom hooks vs. localStorage
- Implemented controlled components for form inputs
- API & Data Fetching
- Integrated with JSONPlaceholder mock API
- Handled loading, error, and success states gracefully
- Learned to cancel fetch requests to prevent memory leaks
- Styling & Responsive Design
- Mastered CSS Modules for scoped styling without conflicts
- Created responsive layouts using CSS Grid and Flexbox
- Implemented dark mode using CSS variables and class toggling
- Used media queries to optimize for mobile, tablet, and desktop
- Component Architecture
- Built reusable, composable components (Button, Input, Card, LoadingSpinner, ErrorMessage)
- Practiced prop drilling and component composition
- Created a consistent design system across the app

Developer Experience
- Used Vite for fast development and optimized builds
- Configured ESLint for code quality
- Practiced Git workflows and meaningful commit messages

Challenges Faced
Challenge 1: Missing CSS Module Files
Problem: The app crashed with "Cannot find module" errors when PostList.module.css was missing.
Solution: Verified all component files have corresponding .module.css files. Created missing files using touch command.

Challenge 2: Like Count Logic
Problem: Initially, like counts weren't persisting and the toggle wasn't working correctly.
Solution: Created the usePostLikes hook to centralize like management, separate from post storage, and properly increment/decrement counts.

Challenge 3: Theme Toggle & Dark Mode
Problem: Dark mode CSS wasn't applying properly across all components.
Solution: Used CSS variables in :root and .dark-theme classes, then toggled the class on document.body using useEffect and localStorage.

Challenge 4: Responsive Grid Layout
Problem: The post grid didn't adapt well to mobile screens (too narrow, unreadable).
Solution: Updated PostList.module.css with media queries: 3 columns (desktop) → 2 columns (tablet) → 1 column (mobile).

Challenge 5: Import/Export Errors
Problem: "Does not provide an export named 'default'" errors when component files were missing export default.
Solution: Ensured every component file ends with export default ComponentName; and verified all imports match exact file names.
